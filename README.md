## Looking Ahead:
 - Getting more users to start populating the website
 - Work on search function to accomodate these incoming posts
 - A delete/admin function to self-edit or audit other user's posts (if the website is abused)

## Project Requirements

   - Performant JavaScript
   - NoSQL databases
   - Progressive Web Applications
   - React single-page applications
   - GraphQL APIs
   - Concurrent servers in a MERN app
   - Authentication



    * Use React for the front end.

    * Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

    * Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

    * Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

    * Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

    * Meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
        * Uses a web manifest
        * Uses a service worker for offline functionality
        * Is installable

    * Have a polished UI.

    * Be responsive.

    * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

    * Include authentication (JWT).

    * Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

    * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

    * Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

# Installation
For private/local use, or to branch off of this codebase on your own, either clone or download the repository to your local computer. Run "npm install" from the root folder (one level above the client and server folders) and the script will install the dependencies for the root, client, and serverside folders. Then run "npm start" from the root folder to start up the application! Heroku deploy friendly ready to go.
